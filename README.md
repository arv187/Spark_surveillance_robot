# Spark_surveillance_robot
Spark_surveillance_robot is my first project with arduino.

My hardware:

Shield deek-motor L298P Shield R3 DC Motor Driver Module 2A H-Bridge 2 way For Arduino UNO 2560
Features:

The Motor Shield is based on the L298 , which is a dual full-bridge driver designed to drive inductive loads such as relays, solenoids, DC and stepping motors. It lets you drive two DC motors with your board, controlling the speed and direction of each one independently. You can also measure the motor current absorption of each motor, among other features.
Operating Voltage 5V to 12V
Motor controller L298P, Drives 2 DC motors or 1 stepper motor
Max current 2A per channel or 4A max (with external power supply)
Current sensing 1.65V/A
Free running stop and brake function
